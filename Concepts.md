## Concept: A sequence-to-sequence model

A sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) language model is a type of neural network architecture designed to transform one sequence into another. It is commonly used in tasks where the input and output are sequences, such as machine translation, text summarization, and chatbot responses.

### Key Characteristics:

- Encoder-Decoder Architecture : Seq2Seq models typically consist of two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and converts it into a fixed-size context vector, which the decoder then uses to generate the output sequence.
- Handling Variable-Length Sequences : Seq2Seq models are capable of handling input and output sequences of varying lengths, making them suitable for tasks where the length of the input and output may differ.
- Attention Mechanism : Many Seq2Seq models incorporate attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence. This improves performance, especially in tasks like translation.
- Applications : Seq2Seq models are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) applications, including translation, summarization, and conversational agents.

## Concept: Tokenizer

A tokenizer is a tool/component that splits sentences into smaller pieces of text (tokens) and assigns each token a numeric value called an input id. This is needed because our model only understands numbers, so we first must convert (a.k.a encode) the text into a format the model can understand. Each model has it’s own tokenizer vocabulary, it’s important to use the same tokenizer that the model was trained on or it will misinterpret the text.

### What a Tokenizer Does:

1. Text Splitting : It breaks down text (like sentences or words) into smaller units called tokens. These could be words, subwords, or characters.
2. Vocabulary Mapping : Each token is converted into a numerical ID that the model can process. The tokenizer maintains a vocabulary that maps tokens to their corresponding IDs.
3. Special Tokens : It adds special tokens like [START], [END], [PAD], or [UNK] (unknown) that help the model understand the structure of the input.

## Concept: Transformers

Hugging Face Transformers is an open-source Python library that provides access to thousands of pre-trained Transformers models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio tasks, and more. It simplifies the process of implementing Transformer models by abstracting away the complexity of training or deploying models in lower level ML frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow and JAX.
